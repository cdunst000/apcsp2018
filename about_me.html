    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p style="color:SlateBlue;">Hi! I'm Carter Dunst and I'm a freshamn at Waukesha North High School. My hobbies are soccer. math, and lots of eating. One of the most important things for me 
    is my schoolwork, and I typically take it very seriously. I might not make valedictorian in the future, but I sure will try. I'm currently on the JV soccer team, and am gradually
    warming up to everyone there. There isn't really much to say about me, other than I love math, puns, soccer, and general good humor. I may be socially awkward, but I in no way will
    ever turn down a conversation.</p>
