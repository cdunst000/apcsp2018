         <p> Welcome to my Scratch Project! It's quite annoying(you should probably turn the sound off), but I tried to make something with 
             most of the extra stuff you can add criteria from the project details. </p>

          <p> Here is my Scratch Animation! This one pretty much sums up my entire personality(I changed the names for some reason)and I'm
              pretty proud of it! </p>

          <p> My final App Inventor project was a GPA Calculator. Originally supposed to be Tic Tac Toe, but I could not figure out how
              to make it for the life of me. The GPA calculator only works in combinations of 8 grades, as it seemed impossible or at least
              to increasingly elaborate to figure out in a program such as App Inventor. I think it looks ok, and it works no matter what you 
              throw at it(Aside from having to insert 8 grades for it work correctly). </p>
